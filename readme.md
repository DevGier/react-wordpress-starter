# React WordPress starter theme

Inspired by [VueJS WordPress theme starter](https://github.com/EvanAgee/vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter/tree/master).

*Why React in a theme?*
This project is made so that WordPress themes can have the same power as a headless website while not having the difficulty of seperating your WordPress installation and frontend.

## Features
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- Amazingly fast compiling and hot refresh with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React Generouted](https://github.com/oedotme/generouted) for creating routes
- SASS/SCSS support
- Eslint for Vite
